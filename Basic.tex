\section*{THE BOY WHO LIVED}%
\label{sec:THE BOY WHO LIVED}%
\flushleft%
 Not for the first time, an argument had broken out over breakfast at number four, Privet Drive.\newline%
	Mr. Vernon Dursley had been woken in the early hours of the morning by a loud, hooting noise from his nephew\newline%
	Harry’s room.“Third time this week!” he roared across the table. “If you can’t control that owl, it’ll have to go!” \newline%
	Harry tried, yet again, to explain.“She’s bored,” he said. “She’s used to flying around outside.\newline%
	If I could just let her out at night —” “Do I look stupid?” snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of fried egg dangling\newline%
	from his bushy mustache. “I know what’ll happen if that owl’s let out.” He exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia. \newline%
	Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long, loud belch from the Dursleys’ son, Dudley.\newline%
	“I want more bacon.” “There’s more in the frying pan, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia,\newline%
	turning misty eyes on her massive son. “We must build you up while we’ve got the chance. . . .\newline%
	I don’t like the sound of that school food. . . .” “Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when I was at Smeltings,”\newline%
	said Uncle Vernon heartily. “Dudley gets enough, don’t you, son?” \newline%
\newline%
	Dudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the kitchen chair, grinned and turned to Harry.\newline%
	“Pass the frying pan.” “You’ve forgotten the magic word,” said Harry irritably.\newline%
	The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was incredible: Dudley gasped and fell off his chair\newline%
	with a crash that shook the whole kitchen; Mrs. Dursley gave a small scream and clapped her hands to her mouth;\newline%
	Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet, veins throbbing in his temples. “I meant ‘please’!” said Harry quickly.\newline%
	“I didn’t mean —” “WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,” thundered his uncle, spraying spit over the table,\newline%
	“ABOUT SAYING THE ‘M’ WORD IN OUR HOUSE?” “But I —” “HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY!” roared Uncle Vernon,\newline%
	pounding the table with his fist. “I just —” “I WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION OF YOUR ABNORMALITY\newline%
	UNDER THIS ROOF!” Harry stared from his purple{-}faced uncle to his pale \newline%
	aunt, who was trying to heave Dudley to his feet. \newline%
\newline%
	Dudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping down his fat bottom. “Why’re you staring at the hedge?” \newline%
	he said suspiciously. “I’m trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire,” said Harry.\newline%
	Dudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on his fat face. “You c{-}can’t — Dad told you you’re\newline%
	not to do m{-}magic — he said he’ll chuck you out of the house — and you haven’t got anywhere else to \newline%
	go — you haven’t got any friends to take you —” “Jiggery pokery!” said Harry in a fierce voice. \newline%
	“Hocus pocus — squiggly wiggly —” “MUUUUUUM!” howled Dudley, tripping over his feet as he dashed\newline%
	back toward the house. “MUUUUM! He’s doing you know what!” Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun.\newline%
	As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn’t really done magic,\newline%
	but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan.\newline%
	Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he wouldn’t eat again until he’d finished.\newline%
	While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream, Harry cleaned the windows,\newline%
	washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the flowerbeds, pruned and watered the roses, \newline%
	and repainted the garden bench. The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his neck. \newline%
	Harry knew he shouldn’t have risen to Dudley’s bait, but Dudley had said the very thing\newline%
	Harry had been thinking himself . . . maybe he didn’t have any friends at Hogwarts. . . . \newline%
	Wish they could see famous Harry Potter now, he thought savagely as he spread manure on the flower beds,\newline%
	his back aching, sweat running down his face. It was half past seven in the evening when at last, exhausted,\newline%
	he heard Aunt Petunia calling him. “Get in here! And walk on the newspaper!” Harry moved gladly\newline%
	into the shade of the gleaming kitchen. On top of the fridge stood tonight’s pudding: a huge mound of \newline%
	whipped cream and sugared violets. A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven. “Eat quickly!\newline%
	The Masons will be here soon!” snapped Aunt Petunia, pointing to two slices of bread and a lump\newline%
	of cheese on the kitchen table. She was already wearing a salmon{-}pink cocktail dress. Harry \newline%
	washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper. The moment he had finished, Aunt Petunia\newline%
	whisked away his plate. “Upstairs! Hurry!” \newline%
\newline%
	As he passed the door to the living room, Harry caught a glimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow ties\newline%
	and dinner jackets. He had only just reached the upstairs landing when the doorbell rang and \newline%
	Uncle Vernon’s furious face appeared at the foot of the stairs. “Remember, boy — one sound —” \newline%
	Harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe, slipped inside, closed the door, and turned to collapse on his bed.\newline%
	The trouble was, there was already someone sitting on it.
